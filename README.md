# HTML CSS Course 2023 - First WebPage

This is the first webpage created to relearn the basics of HTM and review the document structure.<br/>

We will also will review white space collapsing in the editor but the rendering ignores empty spaces. We need to use special html elements to create spacing.<br>

### Lorem Ipsum
We review also how to use emmet to provid text place holder using Lorem Ipsum by typing lorem into the content between element tags. You can limit how many words you want to create by adding the number after the word lorem. Example: lorem50 to get 50 word filled <br/>

### Images
We review the basics on images. Images require attributes of src and alt. The source is the image file location and alt is text in case the image cannot be rendered or for text only browsers and accessibility. We also review relative and absolute paths to src the image file location.<br/>
To use images for commercial or production sites, you will need to use royalty free image from sites like: Pexels, Pixabay or Gratisography <br/>
Now we review the height and width attributes for the img element tag. If we only provide the width tag, then it automatically resizes the height to maintain the image ratios. <br/>
If we uses images that are large, it will slow down the load times. We need to rezise or crop the images prior to loading to improve load speed. <br/>
<br/>
### Comments
To add comments we need to use the "!-- element --" insdie the angle brackets. You can also use the shortcut. CMD+/
<br/>Comments are not displayed on the page<br/>

### External, Internal and Single Page links
To add a link we need to use the a element tag that takes an href attribute that navigates to where you want to send the user. It can also set the target attribute to load the content on a blank new page, or on the existing page.<br/>
To navigate to an section within the same page, we need to add the id attribute to the image and give it a name. Then in the a tag reference that id in the href using the hashtag and name. example: href="#udemy1"<br/><br/>

You also add an empty/dummy link. This is simply a link that does not navigate anywhere. It is simply a placeholder to add the href later. We insert the # for the time being. <br/><br/>

You can also wrap an image or a button rather than text with the a tag. When hovering the mouse pointer over it, it changes the icon to the clickable hand
