# HTML CSS Course 2023 - First WebPage

This is the first webpage created to relearn the basics of HTM and review the document structure.<br/>

We will also will review white space collapsing in the editor but the rendering ignores empty spaces. We need to use special html elements to create spacing.<br>

We review also how to use emmet to provid text place holder using Lorem Ipsum by typing lorem into the content between element tags. You can limit how many words you want to create by adding the number after the word lorem. Example: lorem50 to get 50 word filled <br/>

We review the basics on images. Images require attributes of src and alt. The source is the image file location and alt is text in case the image cannot be rendered or for text only browsers and accessibility. We also review relative and absolute paths to src the image file location.
